# About the Project
This was a group project where we took a public dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/alzheimers-disease-dataset) and employed EDA (Exploratory Data Analytics) techniques such as data preprocessing, visualization, correlation matrix, to obtain insights and using those insights to develop a prediction model that detects whether someone suffers from Alzheimer’s. The Jupyter notebook is a modification of Adham Tarek & Anna Balatska's notebook, taken from https://www.kaggle.com/code/adhamtarek147/alzheimer-s-disease-prediction/notebook. The report is written in the format of a scientific paper which was never published. <ins>This project is for educational purposes only.</ins>

The notebook can be run here on Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vDl_nG9iRDgXxxX1EgItcM5lZxz7nFiB?usp=sharing#scrollTo=2Jx5TP5FTWpm
